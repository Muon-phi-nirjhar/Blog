## Introduction

**Hi there!**, My name is Nirjhar. An amature physics lover to be precise.This is my blog website, where I will post about my recent projects and works.I'm tagging here my recent project , which is a website  made for to help new olympiadians also help who are not new to this, yet need some resources. This website contains questions from other countries physics olympiads , also I had put some pdfs of some physics books, which will help those who are going to participate phy olympiad. That website is not complete yet, new questions and resources should be added now and then.
